# latex-cv

Check the CV here : [English](https://github.com/bhroben/latex-cv/blob/gh-pages/Bhatti_Roben_CV.pdf) or [Italian](https://github.com/bhroben/latex-cv/blob/gh-pages/Bhatti_Roben_CV_ITA.pdf).
This repository contains my CV compiled in LaTeX through a CI/CD pipeline and deployed to GitHub Pages.
The main reason for this repo is that on Overleaf checking previous versions is a paid feature.

## Usage

- Cloning the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine if you want to view or edit the LaTeX source.
- Making Changes: Edit the .tex file as needed. Use the [Latex Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) locally or commit and push changes to trigger the CI pipeline.
- Accessing the PDF: When using the pipeline the latest version of the compiled PDF is available in the branch gh-pages.
